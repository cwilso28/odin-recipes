    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 (12 inch) untreated cedar planks</li>
      <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/3 cup chopped green onions</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 (2 pound) salmon fillets, skin removed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
      <li>Soak cedar planks for at least 1 hour in warm water. Soak longer if you have time.</li>
      <li>Stir soy sauce, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, green onions, ginger, and garlic together in a shallow dish.</li>
      <li>Place salmon fillets in soy mixture and turn to coat. Cover and marinate for at least 15 minutes, or up to 1 hour refrigerated.</li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Place planks on the grill grate. Heat planks until they start to smoke and crackle just a little.</li>
      <li>Remove salmon from marinade and place on planks; discard marinade.</li>
      <li>Close grill cover. Grill salmon until it flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes; salmon will continue to cook after you remove it from the grill.</li>
    </ol>
